# Education Data Analysis

## 1. Do you think the bar chart for `bar_chart_high_school` is an effective data visualization?

**No**, I think this is not good because all the percentage are above 80. The graph need to set a smaller percentage range so that we can see the difference between genders. With a large database, even little percent means large difference.


## 2. HJow and why did you choose the `plot for plot_hispanic_min_degree`?

Because it can show the difference between two kinds of min degrees of Hispanic people, while indicating the trend of the min degree by time as well.

## 3. Describe a possible bias present in this dataset and why it might have occurred.

While collecting this dataset, all min degree starts at high school, it is apparent that the choices starts at that level. However, in past decades, although some developed countries can afford a solid education system providing an at least high school education, there is still a great amount of people, especially the minority like hispanic people, have a min degree under that level. So if there is no category about the educational level lower than high school, a bias may have occurred because of this incomprehension skewing the result. Specifically, the people with lower education level than high school may fake the result with higher education than they actually got. 

## 4. Describe an application, analysis, or decision motivated by this dataset with the intended goal of improving educational equity but that ultimately exacerbates social injustice.

Apparently, some current policies import the percentage of people gained bachelor degrees. To be more "equal", the government may still use the same regulations to enhance this goal and try to let most of the people gain bachelor degree ultimately. However, the resources are always limited. All people have a bachelor degree will mostly reduce the credibility of this degree. In this case, when the people having the same degree increase, a new criteria to distinguish people should be created in order to improve justice. If the government still use this dataset and don't think about the real situation, the homogeneity of regulation will eventually exacerbate social injustice.
