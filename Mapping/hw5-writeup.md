# Food Desert Analysis
## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?

They can determine which region needs more attention by government on developing some new foods sources. Specifically, they can build more foods sources on the place where displays blue on `plot_low_access_tracts`.


## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?

They way we use the graph is a generalized version of the distribution of the national foods sources. However, some regions with enough foods sources as a whole doesn't mean each individual can access enough foods. So the limitation might be that the situation for those already in foods-rich place but are low-access wouldn't change.
