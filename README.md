# CSE163-22wi

There are all Python files with tests (if required) for a CSE163 student taking this course in Winter Quarter 2022 in `University of Washington`. 
Assessment details can be found on course website.

## Assessments
- [x] [Assessment 0](/Startup): Welcome to your first take-home assessment! In every assessment, we will define a set of problems we would like you to solve. Even if the assessment is solving some larger problem, we usually break it up into small sub-problems for you to help manage the work. For this assessment, we have already implemented some buggy solutions to these problems. Your job is to identify and fix the bugs.
- [x] [Assessment 1](/Primer): Apply control structures and data structures to solve problems involving numbers, text, and files.
- [x] [Assessment 2](/Pokemon): Read, process, and group CSV data to compute descriptive statistics with and without Pandas.
- [x] [Assessment 3](/Education): Apply Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to process, visualize, and predict outcomes about data.
- [x] [Assessment 4](/Search): Implement specialized data types with Python classes for tf-idf information retrieval.
- [x] [Assessment 5](/Mapping): Analyze and plot geospatial data to investigate food deserts in Washington.
