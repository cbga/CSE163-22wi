# Education Data Analysis

## 1. Do you think the bar chart for `bar_chart_high_school` is an effective data visualization?

**No**, I think this is not good because all the percentage are above 80. The graph need to set a smaller percentage range so that we can see the difference between genders. With a large database, even little percent means large difference.


## 2. HJow and why did you choose the `plot for plot_hispanic_min_degree`?

Because it can show the difference between two kinds of min degrees of Hispanic people, while indicating the trend of the min degree by time as well.

## 3. Describe a possible bias present in this dataset and why it might have occurred.

The bias may occur based on the different **races**. If the dataset didn't cover the races properly, the prediction will be biased.

## 4. Describe an application, analysis, or decision motivated by this dataset with the intended goal of improving educational equity but that ultimately exacerbates social injustice.
